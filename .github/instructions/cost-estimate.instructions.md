# Azure Cost Estimate Documentation Standards

## Document Purpose

Cost estimates provide:

- Financial clarity for budget approvals
- Architecture context linking cost to design decisions
- Optimization guidance for reducing costs
- Fast decisions via "what changes cost" tables

## General Requirements

- Keep markdown lines <= 120 characters.
- Use ATX headings (`##`, `###`) for sections.
- Use emoji callouts consistently (see "Visual Standards").
- Prefer tables for compare-and-decide content.
- If the workload is small, keep the same sections but shorten them.

## Canonical Templates (Golden Source)

The canonical cost-estimate structure is defined in these templates:

- `.github/skills/azure-artifacts/templates/03-des-cost-estimate.template.md` (design estimate)
- `.github/skills/azure-artifacts/templates/07-ab-cost-estimate.template.md` (as-built estimate)

Agents MUST start from the appropriate template and fill it in.
Do not re-embed long templates in agent bodies.

### Core Heading Contract (Stable)

Both templates MUST contain these exact H2 headings (`##`) in this order:

1. `## 💰 Cost At-a-Glance`
2. `## ✅ Decision Summary`
3. `## 🔁 Requirements → Cost Mapping`
4. `## 📊 Top 5 Cost Drivers`
5. `## Architecture Overview`
6. `## 🧾 What We Are Not Paying For (Yet)`
7. `## ⚠️ Cost Risk Indicators`
8. `## 🎯 Quick Decision Matrix`
9. `## 💰 Savings Opportunities`
10. `## Detailed Cost Breakdown`

Notes:

- Emoji + spacing must match exactly.
- Use the unicode arrow `→` (not `->`) in the Requirements heading.
- Additional H2 headings are allowed, but discouraged (prefer H3s).

## Required Header

```markdown
# Azure Cost Estimate: {Project Name}

**Generated**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Region**: {primary-region}
**Environment**: {Production|Staging|Development}
**MCP Tools Used**: {azure_price_search, azure_cost_estimate, azure_region_recommend, azure_sku_discovery}
**Architecture Reference**: {relative link to assessment doc, if available}
```

## 💰 Cost At-a-Glance (Required)

Include immediately after the header:

````markdown
## 💰 Cost At-a-Glance

> **Monthly Total: ~$X,XXX** | Annual: ~$XX,XXX
>
> ```
> Budget: $X/month (soft|hard) | Utilization: NN% ($X of $X)
> ```
>
> | Status            | Indicator                    |
> | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
> | Cost Trend        | ➡️ Stable                    |
> | Savings Available | 💰 $X/year with reservations |
> | Compliance        | ✅ {e.g., PCI-DSS aligned}   |
````

If no budget is provided, use:

- `Budget: No fixed budget (explain in one sentence)`

## ✅ Decision Summary (Required)

Immediately after "Cost At-a-Glance", include a 2-3 bullet decision summary:

- What's approved now
- What's deferred (intentionally not paying for yet)
- What requirement change would trigger a redesign

Also include a confidence line:

```markdown
**Confidence**: High|Medium|Low | **Expected Variance**: ±X% (1 sentence why)
```

### 12. 📋 Monthly Cost Summary

Include:

- A category summary table
- An ASCII bar distribution (simple, readable)

### 13. 🧮 Base Run Cost vs Growth-Variable Cost

Make variance drivers explicit.

```markdown
## 🧮 Base Run Cost vs Growth-Variable Cost

```

### 14. 🌍 Regional Comparison

Include the primary region and at least one alternative.
Add one sentence explaining why the primary was chosen.

### 15. 🔧 Environment Strategy (FinOps)

Explicitly state prod vs non-prod sizing rules and whether non-prod auto-shutdown is used.

```markdown
## 🔧 Environment Strategy (FinOps)

- Production: {HA/zone strategy, baseline capacity}
- Non-prod: {smaller SKUs, single instance, auto-shutdown schedule}
```

### 16. 🔄 Environment Cost Comparison

If there are multiple environments (prod/staging/dev), include the table.
If single environment, include a short table and state "single environment".

### 17. 🛡️ Cost Guardrails

Tie the estimate to operational enforcement.

```markdown
## 🛡️ Cost Guardrails

| Guardrail      | Threshold   | Action                   |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Budget alert   | 80% / 100%  | Notify / block approvals |
| DB utilization | >80%        | Review tier/queries      |
| Log ingestion  | >X GB/day   | Tune sampling/retention  |
| Egress         | >X GB/month | Investigate CDN/traffic  |
```

### 18. 📝 Testable Assumptions

List 3-5 assumptions most likely to change spend, and how to measure them.

```markdown
## 📝 Testable Assumptions

| Assumption         | Why It Matters             | How to Measure            | Threshold / Trigger |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Egress < 100 GB/mo | keeps networking costs low | Azure Cost Mgmt + metrics | >100 GB/mo          |
| Logs < 5 GB/mo     | avoids ingestion costs     | Log Analytics usage       | >5 GB/mo            |
```

### 19. 📊 Pricing Data Accuracy

Required bullets:

- Usage basis (e.g., 730 hours/month)
- Pricing type (PAYG list price unless otherwise stated)
- Data/egress assumptions
- Prices queried date

### 19. 📊 Pricing Data Accuracy

| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Missing cost drivers   | Include top 5 drivers table                        |
| Missing assumptions    | Document usage and pricing basis                   |
| No "what changes cost" | Include the decision matrix                        |
| No risk callouts       | Include cost risk indicators + a watch item        |
| No savings section     | Always include savings and what is already applied |
| Stale prices           | Note query date; re-validate periodically          |
| Missing change control | Include top 3 likely change requests + delta       |
| Hidden trade-offs      | Add "What we are not paying for (yet)"             |
| Unclear variance       | Add confidence, variance, base vs variable split   |
